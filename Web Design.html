   <h2>INFORMANTION:</h2> 
   <p> Web designing is the <u>process of planning, conceptualizing, and implementing </u> the plan for designing a website in a way that is functional and offers a good user experience. User experience is central to the web designing process. Websites have an array of elements presented in ways that make them <u>easy to navigate </u>. Web designing essentially involves working on every attribute of the website that people interact with, so that the website is <u> simple and efficient </u>, allows users to quickly find the information they need, and looks visually pleasing. All these factors, when combined, decide how well the website is designed. <br>
    Web designers create the <u>design and layout </u> of a website with their technical expertise and knowledge while keeping in mind the client’s requirements. They have a deep understanding of <u>UI (user interface) and UX (user experience) and are adept at using design programs for creating visual elements. </u> With their skills and expertise, web designers capture the brand’s identity in the design elements of the website.
