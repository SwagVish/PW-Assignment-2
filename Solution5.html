    <dt><h2>Tech stack</h2></dt>
    <dd>A tech stack refers to a set of tools, programming languages, and technologies that work together to build digital products or solutions such as websites, mobile, and web apps.

        A tech stack consists of two equally important elements: the <b> frontend </b>(client-side) and <b>backend</b> (server-side). Both work together to create a working tech stack. This is also referred to as an application stack. </dd>
        <dt><h3>Tech Stack Components</h3></dt>
        <dt><b>FRONTEND:</b> </dt>
        <dd>The frontend tech stack is the client’s side of the application. Client-side refers to anything that a user can see or engage with on a screen. The main concern of the frontend stack is to create a stellar user experience, smooth user interface, and straightforward internal structures. In other words, it is responsible for the design, format, and navigation of websites or web apps. <br> There are <b>3 types</b> of Fronted tech Stack:-  <br> <br><dt>HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language):- <dd> it’s a markup language for creating and displaying electronic documents (web pages). They are the backbone in the organization and placement of content on a web page. </dd></dt> <br> <dt>CSS(Cascading style sheets):-  <dd>It is responsible for the format and layout of the web pages. It includes the font styles, sizes, layout, color, and other aspects of a web page. Developers commonly use frameworks like SASS and LESS to make CSS more manageable and more dynamic </dd></dt> <br> <dt>JAVASRIPT:- <dd>Used to make web pages interactive. It’s a programming language that allows you to implement dynamic features on web pages; with common libraries and frameworks like jQuery, React, Angular, and Vue. Many modern applications now also use TypeScript instead of basic JavaScript.</dd>  </dt> </dd> <br>
        <dt><b>BACKEND: </b> <DD>The server-side of software development is the backend tech stack. It refers to the inner workings of a website or app that users cannot see. Think of it as the electric power stations that generate electricity for your home. They may seem invisible in the background, but they are important to keep the operations running smoothly <br>  The backend elements are:- <br> <br>
            <dt>Programming languages – <dd>This creates logic for apps and websites. The code link the web to a database. Some examples are JavaScript, PHP, and Python </dd></dt> <br>
            <dt>Frameworks – <dd>it provides support of applications based on a single programming language. Laravel, Django, and Ruby on Rails are few of the popular frameworks. Most modern applications are built using an MVC style framework </dd> </dt> <br>
            <dt>Web Servers –<dd> You need backend servers to manage client requests. Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft’s Internet Information Server (IIS) are the most common web servers.</dd> </dt>
            <dt>Databases- </dt> <dd> Most applications require a SQL or NoSQL database. MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and MySQL are common databases. </dd> <br>


        </DD> </dt>
        <h2>Top Tech Stack modeles</h2>
        <dt> <b> LAMP </b> <dd> LAMP is an industry-standard when it comes to tech stack models. In web development, it delivers the best cost efficiency, flexibility, and performance. It is an acronym that stands for:

            Linux (operating system)
            Apache (HTTP server)
            MySQL (relational database management)
            PHP (programming language, it can also be Perl or Python)</dd></dt>
            <dt><b>ASP.NET </b> <dd>Microsoft’s .NET Core has been growing in popularity in recent years. Modern .NET applications are very lightweight and can run on Windows and Linux. Microsoft’s embrace of open source technologies has caught the attention of developers all over the world. Now with .NET 5, you don’t have to think as much about .NET Framework vs .NET Core.

                Applications built using .NET commonly use the following application tech stack:
                
                ASP.NET MVC – Standard model-view-controller framework
                IIS – Microsoft’s web server
                Angular frontend framework with TypeScript
                SQL Server – Microsoft’s enterprise database
                Microsoft Azure – A favorite of most .NET developers
                It is also very common to also see .NET applications running on Linux with NGINX and open source databases like Postgresql or Mysql </dd></dt>
                <dt><b>MEAN</b> <dd>One of the well-known tech stacks, MEAN brings numerous benefits to web developers. Among these benefits are the use of a single language (JavaScript) and the underlying technologies are open source and free. MEAN consists of:

                    MongoDB (NoSQL database)
                    Express.js backend web framework
                    Angular.js frontend framework
                    Node.js server-side JavaScript
                    MEAN provides a practical approach to creating fast and highly efficient apps. All the components speak JSON (JavaScript Object Notations) for data transmission and free module library access. This tech stack helps to build scalable software products. It’s great for all types of websites and interactive applications. </dd></dt>
                    <dt><b> MERN </b> <dd>Essentially MERN is similar to MEAN. The difference is that you change Angular.js with React.

                        The key benefits of using MERN are the React integration, the ability to use code on browsers and servers simultaneously, powerful library, and full-stack development option (frontend and backend).
                        
                        Additionally, React is known for its flexibility and performance in developing interactive user interfaces. </dd></dt>
                        <dt><b>MEVN </b> <dd>Another variation of MEAN, MEVN uses Vue.js as the frontend web framework instead of Angular.js. Over the years, Vue.js has grown in popularity. It incorporates the best features of Angular and React.

                            Vue.js is easy to learn, delivers a clear programming style, and provides superb performance for web applications.</dd></dt>
                            <dt><b>Ruby on Rails </b> <dd>Ruby on Rails is a programming environment that uses Ruby, a dynamic programming language. With RoR, you can simplify the entire development process.

                                A server-side web app development written in the Ruby programming language requires less knowledge to work on. It allows the use of default structures for database management and web pages.
                                
                                Ruby on Rails works well with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating UIs and JSON or XML for transferring data.
                                
                                 While Ruby on Rails was extremely popular in the late 2010s, it has experienced a sharp decline in usage over the past three years. Fewer developers are choosing to specialize in this framework, which means finding Ruby on Rails developers has become increasingly difficult and expensive. </dd> </dt>
                                <dt><b>Python </b> <dd>One of the fastest-growing languages is Python. It is easy to use and commonly taught to college students as a beginner development language. It has many modern and powerful features. Python has also become very popular because of its heavy usage for machine learning and data science. It can also be used for building web applications by using the popular Django web framework.</dd> </dt>
                                <dt><b>Java </b> <dd>Java is not as popular as it once was. It is popular for enterprise applications, but new projects tend to gravitate to newer and lighter-weight application stacks like Node.js and Python. Java is still heavily used and there are lots of Java developers all over the world.
